        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run
          by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring
          nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers
          who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members
          told us:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I
          think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless."

            What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage
            Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur
            roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum of
            Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused
            on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has
            conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
